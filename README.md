Pre-requisites.

1. Please install Python any version >= 3.6.2 
2. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
	a) Choose https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ if you want to install in Windows

3. Follow the install instructions. 
4. Try to open a "terminal" and run the file as follows

python google-street-view-save.py

It will open a small window asking for latitude, longitude and foldername for the class and then click "Done". Remember we discussed each intersection as being a class type. Play around with a few local crosswalk intersection coordinates from google map and check the folders after it is done downloading. Slack me  if you have any questions
